		<ol class="text-justify reasons">
			<li>Our designs are fully responsive.  They scale great with smart phones.  Tablets.  And any size computer.  Our designs are logical with dynamic functionality and animation.</li>
			<li>We use high quality.  Newer.  Fast Virtual Private Nginx Servers.  They have Ubuntu 16.04 x 64 bit (a Linux operating system and distribution).  It only costs $5 per month for a standard business website.  You'll have your own space RESERVED.  On a private server 24/7/365.  This will allow fast.  Dependable.  Quality service.</li>
			<li>We set up your server completely for a turnkey site.  All you have to do is search for it online.  This will save you +-$20 - $30 per month.</li>
			<li>We advise against shared hosting.  Shared hosting companies typically cram 1,000's of websites on an older.  Average quality server.  It's basically first come first serve.  When a lot of people come to these sites at the same time, these servers typically go down.  It costs $4-$6 per month for a single website.  See #2 above... right?  But if you want.  We will accommodate.</li>						
			<li>We develop Wordpress and Drupal websites.  These CMS's (Content Management Systems) do allow for quick.  And quality website development.  They provide easy to use backends.  Where you can manage the front end.  However. They do have customizing limitations.</li>
			<li>We only develop on Apple OS X.  I know.  I've had many different computers.  With different operating systems.  And they were all great!  But when it comes to web development.  Trust me.  Well you know... If we don't break.  You won't have to wait.</li>
			<li>We like to work smart.  We work with Sublime Text 3 IDE (integrated development environment).  And use the top plugins including Emmet.  We use custom snippets.  Key bindings.  Macros.  And of course, Sublime's super autocompletion.   This allows for much quicker coding.  Without losing quality.</li>
			<li>We develop with top frameworks.  Such as Ruby on Rails (Ruby language).  Laravel (PHP language).  ReactJS (Javascript library using one way data flow and efficient rendering). Developing custom websites is sooooo much faster when using high quality.  Well supported frameworks.  These frameworks get faster every day.  They are a must if you are not using Wordpress or Drupal.</li>
