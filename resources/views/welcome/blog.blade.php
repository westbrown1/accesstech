		 			<h4 class="text-center">Could Marsha Brady have broken up with Mitch Trubisky in some sort of strange time warp brought on by that hardlined 1970's telephone? </h4>
		 			<p>Last night, the 10th of November 2016. On Thursday Night College Football. The Duke Blue Devils handed The North Carolina Tarheel football team quite a blow, 28-27.  The game was close in the first half, despite the Tarheels' lack of defense.  Yes, UNC your defense needs just a tiny, little bit of work.  It was also close the second half. In the end, David Cutcliffe's Duke squad seemed to simply want it a little more.  As a result, The Tarheels' slim chances of even facing Dabo Swinney and the #2 ranked Clemson Tigers seemed to disappear.  What happened?  We're not sure but we suspect it had something to do with 1970's sideline telephone Mitch Trubisky was talking on during the game. <br><br>
		 			The cameras were focusing on Mitch during the third and fourth quarter.  Could he be talking on the hardlined '70's phone with the offensive coordinators upstairs.  Apparently not.  Trubisky, who was cool the entire time on the phone, seemed to lose second half focus.  Taking a little more time searching for receivers.  As he took the snap back he seemed to be a little less lively and fired up.  Could this have been because the Blue Devil's defense had adjusted and was playing better?  Most likely no.
		 			<br><br>
		 			We speculate that Mitch may have talking to Marsha Brady on the 1970's phone.  Maybe some kind of time warp double life he has been living.  Maybe Marsha broke up with Mitch during the third quarter.  It's hard to tell.  Then came the mixed signal with Bug Howard in the fourth quarter and suddenly it was over.  The interception was thrown and Mitch looked at Bug like, can't you see I'm not my usual self.<br><br>
		 		 	Listen, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Mitch Trubisky.  I still think he is the best professional style quarterback in the country.  You know the drop back passer type that will be around long after Cam Newton breaks both his knees and one shoulder.  The type with the strong, accurate arm.  The one who is atheletic and can really move when he needs to but doesn't overdo it.  If I were the NFL coach and GM with the #1 draft pick, there would be no hesitation.  I'll take Mitch Trubisky, Thank You.  But listen Mitch.  Girls like Marsha Brady are bound to break your heart.  Get off the phone and get on the sideline and root on your defense buddy.  Stay fired up and good things will happen.<br><br>
