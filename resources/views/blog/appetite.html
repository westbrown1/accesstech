	 			<p class="reasons">I was hungry between meals today and researched the best way to curb my appetite.  When I clicked on Wikihow, I discovered that brushing my teeth with a mint toothpaste should curb my appetite.  And guess what, it did!  Now I have a ferocious appetite.  I'm pretty sure I could be a professional eater.  You know, one those people who could eat a thousand hot dogs in 10 minutes.  Well maybe not a thousand, but a lot of hot dogs.  Anyway, if you want to lose some weight, eat a reasonable portion of healthy food, then stop and go brush your teeth.  You might be surprised at what the mint flavored toothpaste can do for your appetite, and your breath!  

	 			Take a toothbrush and tube to work with you.  If you're going out to eat at a restaurant.  Or going to a Super Bowl party.  Take a miny tube and toothbrush with you.  After eating a sensible portion of food, excuse yourself to the restroom and have a quick brush.  Be sure to do it before dessert time...

	 			A bonus tip, if you cannot get over your desire for a Big Mac and large fry.  Stop.  Take time to search "Nutrition in a Big Mac".  Then check out the fat grams in 1 Big Mac vs the RDA.  This may help slow your drive.  Good luck and Thanks!</p><br>
