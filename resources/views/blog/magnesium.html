	 			<h4 class="text-center">Positive Health Effects of Magnesium, The Super Mineral.</h4>

	 			<p class="reasons">An estimated 80% of the human population is deficient in the essential mineral magnesium.  Magnesium is involved in over 300 metabolic reactions.  Magnesium is crucial in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthesis within the mitochondria of a cell .  Magnesium benefits are associated with stroke and heart health, high blood pressure, asthma, bone and teeth health (osteoporosis), collagen production (healthy skin, hair), type 2 diabetes (improved insulin sensitivity), weight control (improved insulin sensitivity), fatigue (maintaining energy throughout the day), anxiety, muscle cramping, blood coagulation, headaches, sleep (muscle relaxation), constipation.  Yeah, it's a super mineral.  Many health experts say it is the most important dietary mineral.  However, too much of a good thing is not so good.  It's a laxative so diarrhea is a sign of too much.  I take any magnesium supplements later at night when I know I'm not going out.  RDA for men is +-410 mg and +-360 mg for women.  The tolerable upper intake supplementation is 350 mg/day for adults.  The Linus Pauling Institute is a good source of infomation on magnesium.  It is the source for most of this information.<br><br>
	 			Good food sources of magnesium include spinach, cereal, brown rice, almonds, Swiss chard (cooked), peas, avocados, oatmeal, broccoli, bananas, kidney beans, dark chocolate.</p><br>
