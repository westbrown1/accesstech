	 			<p class="reasons">Let's face it, if you were a defensive coach in the NFL, which would you rather have.  A 30 yard pass interference penalty and automatic firstdown or give up a 55 yard touchdown?  Hum, pretty easy right?  Okay, If you're a wide receiver and your quarterback's pass is about to be intercepted on your own 20 yard line.  Do you think it would be better to interfere with the defender so he doesn't catch the ball and trot into the end zone.  I thing the best decision would be to take the 10 yard penalty from the previous spot and loss of down.  Really?  Who made up these rules.  They reward cheating.  Especially in a big playoff or Super Bowl Game.

	 			Let's look at our first example, defensive interference.  Guess what?  There are additional benefits to committing the penalty.  A completion assists in allowing your opponent to establish rhythm AND momentum (confidence).  We all know how important these are on a big stage with millions watching.  And this is magnified even more in a Super Bowl.  Where emotions can be very high or end up very low.  If you watched the Super Bowl 51, this was very much displayed by The Atlanta Falcons.  On the Patriot's second to last drive in the first half, there were at least three intentional holding/pass interference penalties.  It was sound coaching and play on display.  At least one of these penalties prevented a touchdown.  Not only that, they kept The Patriots from getting into that all important rhythm.  Atlanta's defense kept staying alive.  Then boom, they got an interception and ran it back for an 80 yard touchdown.  A 14 point swing in the Super Bowl.  All because of intentional penalties.  Unless the rules are changed to make intentional penalties much more costly.  Perhaps like basketball, a limit on the number of intentional penalties before expulsion from the game and a SERIOUS fine on the organization.  Maybe two?  I don't know, it's open for discussion.

	 			Now how about the offensive line coach.  Would he like to see his quarterback viciously sacked.  Increasing the possibility of injury.  Probably not.  So as a last resort, intentionally hold the defender so he doesn't lay a finger on the quarterback. Sure, you get a ten yard penalty, BUT, you get to replay the down!  Great Rule!  Pretty okay for the offense, in my opinion.

	 			Do the announcers talk much about this.  Noooo way, that would be way to bad.  What kind of example would this set for our youth? </p><br>
